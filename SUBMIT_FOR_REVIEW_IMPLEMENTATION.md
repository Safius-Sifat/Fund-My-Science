# ✅ Submit for Review Implementation Complete

## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED**: Missing submission workflow for projects

Previously, projects were automatically submitted for DAO review upon creation. Now we have implemented a proper workflow where researchers can:

1. **Create Draft Projects** → Save and edit privately
2. **Submit for Review** → Manually submit when ready for DAO evaluation
3. **DAO Approval Process** → Only submitted projects appear in DAO governance

---

## 🛠️ **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **New Project Creation Flow**
- **Status**: Projects created as `draft` initially 
- **No Auto-Proposal**: Proposals are NOT automatically created
- **Editable**: Draft projects can be edited before submission
- **Document Storage**: Proposal documents stored in project for later use

### **Submit for Review Button**
- **Location**: "My Projects" page for draft projects
- **Action**: Changes project status from `draft` → `pending_approval`
- **Proposal Creation**: Creates proposal entry with `dao_status: 'pending_vote'`
- **Document Transfer**: Moves proposal document URL to proposal table

### **DAO Governance Integration**
- **Filtered View**: Only shows projects with `status: 'pending_approval'`
- **Voting Process**: Unchanged - validators vote on submitted proposals
- **Blockchain Sync**: Approved projects sync to blockchain and become `active`

## 🔄 **COMPLETE PROJECT LIFECYCLE**

### 1. **Draft Phase** (`status: 'draft'`)
- ✅ Researcher creates project
- ✅ Can edit project details
- ✅ Can upload/change documents
- ✅ **NEW**: "Submit for Review" button available
- ❌ Not visible to DAO validators
- ❌ Cannot receive investments

### 2. **Under Review** (`status: 'pending_approval'`)
- ✅ **NEW**: Shows "Under DAO Review" status
- ✅ Visible in DAO Governance for validators
- ✅ Validators can vote approve/reject
- ❌ Cannot be edited by researcher
- ❌ Cannot receive investments

### 3. **Approved & Active** (`status: 'active'`)
- ✅ DAO voted to approve
- ✅ **NEW**: Automatically syncs to blockchain
- ✅ Can receive investments
- ✅ Milestone management active
- ❌ Cannot be edited

### 4. **Rejected** (`dao_status: 'rejected'`)
- ✅ DAO voted to reject
- ✅ Researcher notified
- ✅ Could potentially be revised and resubmitted
- ❌ Cannot receive investments

## 🗂️ **FILES MODIFIED**

### **Backend/Database**
- `database/dao-governance-migration.sql` - Added `proposal_document_url` to projects table

### **Frontend Components**
- `src/app/projects/create/page.tsx` - Removed auto-proposal creation, store document URL
- `src/app/projects/my/page.tsx` - Added submit for review button and functionality
- `src/components/DAOGovernance.tsx` - Filter to only show `pending_approval` projects
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Enabled researcher navigation links

### **User Interface**
- **Create Project**: Now saves as draft, redirects to "My Projects"
- **My Projects**: Shows submit button for drafts, "Under Review" status for pending
- **DAO Governance**: Only shows properly submitted projects
- **Navigation**: Researchers can access "My Projects" and "Create Project"

## 🧪 **TESTING THE NEW FLOW**

### **As Researcher:**
1. Create project → Saved as draft
2. Go to "My Projects" → See draft project with edit/submit options
3. Click "Submit for Review" → Status changes to pending_approval
4. See "Under DAO Review" status → Cannot edit anymore

### **As Validator:**
1. Go to DAO Governance → Only see projects that were submitted for review
2. Vote on proposals → Approved projects become active and sync to blockchain
3. Check project status → Active projects can receive investments

### **Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check project status flow
SELECT id, title, status, proposal_document_url FROM projects ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check proposals created only after submission
SELECT p.project_id, pr.title, p.dao_status, p.created_at 
FROM proposals p 
JOIN projects pr ON p.project_id = pr.id 
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

## ✨ **BENEFITS OF NEW WORKFLOW**

### **For Researchers:**
- ✅ **Privacy**: Can work on drafts privately before submission
- ✅ **Control**: Choose when to submit for review
- ✅ **Quality**: Can refine proposals before DAO sees them
- ✅ **Editing**: Can modify drafts until satisfied

### **For DAO Validators:**
- ✅ **Intentional Submissions**: Only see projects researcher wants reviewed
- ✅ **Ready Projects**: All submitted projects are complete and intentional
- ✅ **Better Quality**: Researchers self-filter before submission
- ✅ **Clear Status**: Easy to see what needs voting

### **For System:**
- ✅ **Proper Workflow**: Clear distinction between draft and submitted projects
- ✅ **Blockchain Efficiency**: Only approved projects sync to blockchain
- ✅ **Database Organization**: Cleaner separation of draft vs live projects
- ✅ **User Experience**: More intuitive project management flow

## 🚀 **RESULT**: Complete Project Management Workflow

The FundMyScience platform now has a **complete, professional project management workflow** that matches how researchers actually work:

1. **Draft & Refine** → Work privately on project details
2. **Submit When Ready** → Explicitly submit for DAO review  
3. **DAO Evaluation** → Community validates submitted projects
4. **Blockchain Deployment** → Approved projects become live for funding
5. **Investment & Milestones** → Active projects can receive investments

This implementation resolves the missing "Submit for Review" functionality and creates a much more professional and user-friendly experience! 🎉
