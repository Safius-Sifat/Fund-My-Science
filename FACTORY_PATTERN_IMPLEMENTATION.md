# Factory Pattern Implementation - Phase 5 Complete

This document outlines the completed Factory pattern implementation for Fund My Science, transitioning from a monolithic contract to a scalable, modular architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Previous Architecture (Monolithic)
- Single `FundMyScience.sol` contract handling all functionality
- ETH-based investments
- All projects stored in one contract

### New Architecture (Factory Pattern)
- **ProjectFactory.sol**: Master contract that creates and manages individual projects
- **ProjectEscrow.sol**: Individual escrow contract for each project
- **ProjectToken.sol**: ERC-20 tokens representing project shares
- **MockUSDC.sol**: Testing token for USDC functionality

```

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. USDC Integration
- Stable currency payments instead of volatile ETH
- 6-decimal precision for accurate funding calculations
- Two-step investment process: approve → fund

### 2. Individual Project Escrows
- Each project gets its own secure escrow contract
- Isolated funding and milestone management
- Better security and organization

### 3. Project Tokens (ERC-20)
- Investors receive tokens representing project ownership
- Tradeable shares in research projects
- Automatic minting based on investment amounts

### 4. DAO Governance
- Only DAO can create new projects
- DAO controls milestone releases
- Decentralized project management

### 5. Platform Sustainability
- 5% platform fee on milestone releases
- Configurable fee structure
- Revenue sharing with platform wallet

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Start Local Blockchain
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat node
```

### 2. Deploy Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-factory.js --network localhost
```

### 3. Update Frontend Configuration
Copy the contract addresses from deployment output to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS=0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
```

### 4. Configure MetaMask
- Add localhost:8545 network
- Import deployer private key for testing
- Connect to the application

### 5. Test the System
Navigate to `/blockchain-demo` to:
- Get test USDC tokens
- Invest in demo project
- See Factory pattern in action

## 📋 Contract Details

### ProjectFactory.sol
**Purpose**: Master contract that creates and manages all projects
**Key Functions**:
- `createProject()`: Creates new project with escrow and token
- `getProjectEscrow()`: Returns escrow address for project
- `getProjectCount()`: Returns total number of projects

### ProjectEscrow.sol
**Purpose**: Individual escrow vault for each project
**Key Functions**:
- `fund()`: Accept USDC investments and mint project tokens
- `releaseMilestone()`: Release funds to researcher (DAO only)
- `getProjectInfo()`: Return project funding status

### ProjectToken.sol
**Purpose**: ERC-20 tokens representing project ownership
**Key Functions**:
- `mint()`: Mint tokens for investors (escrow only)
- `getSharePercentage()`: Calculate ownership percentage
- Standard ERC-20 functions for transfers

### MockUSDC.sol
**Purpose**: Test token mimicking USDC for development
**Key Functions**:
- `faucet()`: Get 1000 test USDC tokens
- Standard ERC-20 functions with 6 decimals

## 🔄 Investment Flow

### Traditional Flow (Old)
1. User connects wallet
2. User sends ETH directly to contract
3. Investment recorded in single contract

### New Factory Flow
1. User connects wallet
2. User gets test USDC (via faucet)
3. User approves USDC spending to project escrow
4. User calls fund() on project escrow
5. Escrow transfers USDC and mints project tokens
6. User receives ERC-20 tokens representing ownership

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

### Access Control
- Factory creation restricted to DAO
- Milestone releases controlled by DAO
- Token minting restricted to escrow contracts

### Fund Safety
- Individual escrows prevent cross-project contamination
- USDC provides stable value storage
- Milestone-based fund releases

### Transparency
- All events logged for database synchronization
- Project funding tracked independently
- Clear ownership through token balances

## 🧪 Testing Features

### Demo Page (`/blockchain-demo`)
- **USDC Faucet**: Get test tokens for investment
- **Project Investment**: Test the complete investment flow
- **Real-time Updates**: See balances and project status
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages

### Test Project
The deployment script creates a test project:
- **Title**: "Test Quantum Research Project"
- **Goal**: 10,000 USDC
- **Milestones**: 3,000 + 4,000 + 3,000 USDC
- **Token Symbol**: TQRP

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### 1. Production USDC Integration
- Replace MockUSDC with real USDC contract
- Multi-network deployment (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

### 2. Advanced Token Features
- Token burning for failed projects
- Dividend distributions
- Governance rights for token holders

### 3. Enhanced DAO Features
- Multi-signature milestone approval
- Automated milestone verification
- Community voting on project disputes

### 4. Database Integration
- Sync blockchain events with Supabase
- Real-time project status updates
- Historical investment tracking

## 📊 Performance Benefits

### Gas Efficiency
- Cloning pattern reduces deployment costs
- Individual contracts prevent unnecessary gas usage
- Optimized for repeated operations

### Scalability
- Unlimited project creation
- Independent project management
- No single contract bottlenecks

### Maintainability
- Modular contract architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to upgrade individual components
